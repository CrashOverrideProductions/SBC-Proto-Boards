### Details
The BadUSB is intended to be a budget alternative to the current offering of Keystroke Injection tools available on the market.

### What is a Keystroke Injection Attack?
A Keystroke Injection Attack Tool is a specially designed USB device, often disguised as a thumb drive, that automatically runs code on any host computer into which it is plugged. It does so by appearing to the computer as a USB HID ('Human Interface Device') keyboard and/or mouse, and then “typing” in keyboard shortcuts and commands.
